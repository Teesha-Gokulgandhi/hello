# TrashToCash Website Setup Instructions

## üöÄ Quick Start

This MERN stack application has been successfully created and is ready for development. Follow these steps to get it running:

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB (v4.4 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### 1. Start MongoDB
Make sure MongoDB is running on your system:
```bash
# On macOS (with Homebrew)
brew services start mongodb-community

# On Ubuntu
sudo systemctl start mongod

# On Windows
# Start MongoDB service from Services or run mongod.exe
```

### 2. Setup Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install

# The server is configured to run on port 5000
npm run dev
```

The backend will start on http://localhost:5000

### 3. Setup Frontend (in a new terminal)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install

# Fix any Grid component issues by downgrading MUI if needed
npm start
```

The frontend will start on http://localhost:3000
